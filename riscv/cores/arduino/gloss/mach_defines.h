/* -------------- GFX subsystem defines --------------------- */

/** 
Memory address base of the registers of the graphics subsystem 

The GFX subsystem has four layers: the framebuffer layer, two tile
layers and one sprite layer. The framebuffer layer is generated by
using a user-specified framebuffer memory region in PSRAM and
interpreting the bytes or nibbles in there as a 4- or 8-bit bitmap.
That data is then used verbatim as a graphics layer.

The tile layers work as follows. Every 64 bytes in the tile memory are
interpreted as an 16x16-pixel, 4-bit image known as a 'tile'. As the
tile memory is 16K, this means there is a total of 512 tiles. These tiles
are shared between the two tile layers and the sprite layer.

A tilemap is an 64x64 map of 9-bit indexes into the tile memory: it 
describes a 'virtual' (64*16)x(64x16)=1024x1024 bitmap. This 'virtual'
bitmap is then referred to when filling in the 'real' 480x32 layer that
goes to the LCD/HDMI: the pixel at (0,0) is looked up in the 'virtual'
bitmap at (x,y)=(GFX_TILEx_OFF.x,GF_TILEx_OFF.y). Then, for each increase
in X on the 'real' layer, (GFX_TILEx_INC_COL.x,GFX_TILEx_INC_COL.y) is 
added to the (x,y) coordinates, while for each increase in Y, 
(GFX_TILEx_INC_ROW.x,GFX_TILEx_INC_ROW.y) is added. Note that all these
values are specified in (1/64)th pixel, so e.g. to make the 'real' (0,0)
pixel map to the 'virtual' (10, 20) pixel, you would set 
GFX_TILEA_OFF to (640<<16)|1280.

Sprites are defined in their own memory. Each sprite has a position
on screen and an associated 16x16 tile from the main tile memory. Sprites
can be scaled, that is, you can set an X and Y size and the sprite will
scale the 16x16 tile to be that size. Note that palette index 0 in these
sprites always is transparent. Other palette entries may be transparent
using alpha values, however this will only apply when a single sprite is 
placed over a background. If sprites are placed over eachother, if a 
non-zero palette index pixel is placed, it will always entirely overwrite
the sprite pixel that was there beforehand.

A note on colors: When compositing the final layers, all tile / FB colors 
are looked up in the palette memory, resulting in a bunch of RGBA colors. These
are mixed according to their alpha values, so it's possible to create 
semitranslucent effects. When RGBA values need to be specified, (e.g. to
fill the palette memory), the fields are
[31:24]: Alpha value. 0xff is opaque, 0x0 is fully transparent
[23:16]: Red value
[15:8]: Green value
[7:0]: Blue value

/* 
The FPGA SoC has a dedicated synthesizer (loosely inspired by the SID) and
an audio output subsystem.  The board itself has a single logic output pin 
that passes through a lowpass RC filter into an amplifier.

The rest is done in code.

The synthesizer has eight simultaneous voices, mixed together with fixed 
volume in two groups.  Each voice has its own attack and release parameters, 
and can be set to sound for a given duration.  Attack and release are each 
eight bit values, set in per-voice configuration registers.

Sending a duration and pitch to a voice's "play" register makes it start 
immediately into its attack phase, play for the duration, and then taper
slowly off according to the release value. Note that you are responsible
for timing.  The synth just handles duration.

There is a README in the soc/audio subdirectory if you want to know more,
but this should get you started.

## Layout:

80000000 Voice 0 : Sawtooth
80000010 Voice 1 : Sawtooth
80000020 Voice 2 : Pulse + Sub
80000030 Voice 3 : Square
80000040 Voice 4 : Triangle
80000050 Voice 5 : Triangle
80000060 Voice 6 : Triangle
80000070 Voice 7 : Triangle

800000C0 Raw PCM input: 14-bit samples, but hit it with whatever you got 
         Sample rate is determined by whatever you push in,

800000D0 Drums (Still TBD) Bits: Kick drum, Snare, Hat/Cymbal, Cowbell

800000F0 Config register

## Voice Registers: for voice and drums X

0x800000X0: PLAY register: 
	    0xDDDDPPPP Pitch accumulator and duration. 
0x800000X4: CONFIG register: 
	    0x0000RRAA Attack and release are both 0-255	    
0x800000X8: Filter parameters, reserved.
0x800000XC: Beats me.

## PCM Register: just write raw data in

800000C0:  PCM_PLAY:
	   0x0000PPPP 16-bit PCM data, mixed with the synth voices 
           Note: PCM can get loud. Try global volumes around 0x0100.

## Config Register:
0x800000F0: VOLume
	    0x0000VVVV Sixteen bit global volume. 
	    0x200 is nominal for four simultaneous voices
	    If it's distorting, turn it down.

## Examples:
   SYNTHREG(AUDIO_CONFIG_VOLUME) = 0x100; 
   will set master volume a little lower, good for PCM or many voices
   (see audio.c and audio.h in IPL for tables)

   SYNTHREG(AUDIO_VOICE_SAW1 + AUDIO_CONFIG_REG_OFFSET) = \
			AUDIO_ATTACK(10) + AUDIO_RELEASE(255);
   sets the SAW1 voice to a very slow attack and a nearly instant release
   
   SYNTHREG(AUDIO_VOICE_SAW1) = AUDIO_PITCH(0x0C00) + AUDIO_DURATION(0x0120);
   will play the sawtooth voice 1 for around 100 ms at around 137 Hz
